<h3>The Unpopular Music Player</h3>
<h4>Unpopular Player or Unpopular Music?</h4>

<p>This ambiguity only works in English. In other languages it would be clear if either
    the music or the player is unpopular.<br>
    "Unpopular" itself is a pun I got from <a
            href="http://www.thewelltemperedcomputer.com/TG/2_Classical.html">here</a>.
    As "pop music" means "popular music", any other music obviously must be unpopular.

<h4>Why the (n + 1)-st Music Player?</h4>

<p>The <i>Unpopular Music Player</i> is not designed for pop music only, but also deals with opus,
    composer etc.. Further is does not truncate long opus and movement names. The goal is to present an opus in
    the same way it would be presented on a CD box or in a concert programme.</p>

<p>By the way, the word "song" is not used in its user interface.</p>

<h4>Tagging of Audio Files</h4>

<p>Of course the application can only show what is stored inside the music files, in the so
    called "tags" (meta information). If these are wrong or incomplete, one could use handy
    applications like Kid3, Qoobar, iTunes or similar to repair or add information especially
    for classical music. Additionally to the usual meta information, like "album", "track
    number", "CD number", "title", the <i>Unpopular Music Player</i> mainly relies on "composer"
    and "group" (used for opus), but also shows "year" resp. "date" and "conductor", if
    existing.</p>

<h4>Folders and Album Titles</h4>

<p>A sensible organisation of music on the device is to use one folder for each
    album, and additionally to the music files (mp3, mp4 or similar) this folder should contain
    a picture called "folder.jpg" in order to help the Android system with file and album
    management. By the way: files named like "frontpage.jpg" would be shown the photo gallery,
    which usually is unintended.</p>

<h4>Repair Database Inconsistencies</h4>

<p>The <i>Unpopular Music Player</i> uses the media file management provided by the Android
    system. In case the information shown is wrong or inconsistent, there are some advices to
    rebuild the internal media database. What could work is to clear all data of the internal
    "Media Storage" (recommended for 4.4) or of the standard music play application (recommended
    for 5.x), to reboot and then (for 5.x) start the standard music player again.</p>

<h4>Final Words</h4>

<p>Writing this application took lots of time, and putting it to the Play Store
    took both <b>time and money</b>. However, I decided to provide the application <b>free and
        without advertisements</b> for people liking classical music. So please rate this "opus
    1" benevolently and in doubt first send me a message instead of providing a bad rating.
    <br>Thanks in advance!</p>
